## EA 1: Git

### What is Git?

If you're interested in continuing coding as a career, hobby, or anything else, then learning how to use Git is essential. **Git** is what we call a "version control system;" in other words, its a way to record and save our code similar to how we would save a Google Doc or Powerpoint. Using Git provides an efficient way to save the progress of our code and is a necessary skill for programmers in any industry.
