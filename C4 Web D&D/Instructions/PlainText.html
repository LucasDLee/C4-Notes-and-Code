			<h2>Making HTML, CSS and JS Files on Our Computers</h2>
			<p>Many programmers code on their local computer without needing something like Repl.it. Here, I'll help you transfer your Repl.it website to your PC:</p>
            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a folder to save all of your stuff</li>
                <li>Open <b>TextEdit</b> and change your empty file into a plain text file <b>(.txt)</b> through the <b>format tab</b></li>
                <li>Copy and paste your HTML, CSS, and JS code into 3 separate files and save those files into your folder with the same name as your files on Repl.it.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a folder to save all of your stuff</li>
                <li>Open <b>Notepad</b> and copy and paste your HTML, CSS, and JS code into 3 separate files.</li>
                <li>Save those files into your folder with the same name as your files on Repl.it</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Other Operating Systems</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Let me know if you don't have Windows or Apple and I'll help you figure it</li>
            </ol>
