			<h2>Using CSS to Style a Ordered List</h2>
			<p>Using CSS, we want to be able to add stylings to our HTML items to make our website look nice. In this activity, I want you to add stylings to all ordered lists (ol):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Change all of the list items in an ordered list to "orange"</li>
				<li>Add a border with a width of "1px" with a style of "dashed" to the entire ordered list
</li>
				<li>Change the numbers to "circle" using list-style-type
</li>
			</ul>
