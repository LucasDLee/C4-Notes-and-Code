## Basic JavaScript

Try using JavaScript to print the following to the console:

- The word "apple" as a string
- Connect the strings "someplace", "in", "richmond" without putting them in the same quotation marks
  - Bad (don't do this): console.log("someplace in richmond")
- Create 2 variables called ``num1`` and ``num2`` with **num1 = 54** and **num2 = 34**. Do the following with these variables:
  - Add two numbers together (answer is 88)
  - Use modulo to get the remainder of two numbers (answer is 20)
  - Divide num1 by num2 (answer is 1.588235294117647)
  - Multiply num1 by num2 (answer is 1836)
  - Change ``num1`` to equal 34
  - Check if ``num1`` is less than ``num2``
