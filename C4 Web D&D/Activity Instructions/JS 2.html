			<h2>JavaScript Conditions</h2>
			<p>Here, we'll be trying out some conditional statements ourselves. Do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make a variable called "dice" and assign it a value of -1</li>
				<li>Create an if-statement that checks the following:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>If "dice" is a multiple of both 2 and 5, print "You have rolled a multiple of 10"</li>
						<li>Else if "dice" is even (dice % 2 == 0), print "This is an even number" to the console</li>
						<li>Else if "dice" is a multiple of 5 (dice % 5 == 0), print "You have rolled a multiple of 5"</li>
						<li>Finally, have the default value print "I cannot understand your dice roll"</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			</main>
