## Using CSS to Style a Ordered List

Using CSS, we want to be able to add stylings to our HTML items to make our website look nice. In this activity, I want you to add stylings to all ordered lists (ol):

- Change all of the list items in an ordered list to the text colour of "orange"
- Add a border with a width of "1px" with a style of "dashed" to the entire ordered list
- Change the numbers to "circle" using list-style-type
