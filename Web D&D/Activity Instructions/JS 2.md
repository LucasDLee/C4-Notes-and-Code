# Activity Instructions

## JavaScript Conditions

Here, we'll be trying out some conditional statements ourselves. Do the following:

- Make a variable called ``dice`` and assign it any number you want
- Create an if-statement that checks the following:
  - If ``dice`` is a multiple of both 2 and 5, print "You have rolled a multiple of 10"
  - Else if ``dice`` is even (dice % 2 == 0), print "This is an even number" to the console
  - Else if ``dice`` is a multiple of 5 (dice % 5 == 0), print "You have rolled a multiple of 5"
  - Finally, have the default value print "I cannot understand your dice roll"

The second part of this activity is to try out ``switch`` statements:

- Make a variable called ``city`` that is equal to any city you want
- Create a switch-statement that checks the folowing:
  - If it is "Vancouver", print "Welcome to Vancouver"
  - If it is "Ottawa", print "You are in the capital of Canada"
  - If it is "Toronto", print "Toronto is big"
  - Otherwise print "I don't recognize this city"
