## JavaScript Conditions

Here, we'll be trying out some conditional statements ourselves. Do the following:

- Make a variable called ``dice`` and assign it a value of -1
- Create an if-statement that checks the following:
  - If ``dice`` is a multiple of both 2 and 5, print "You have rolled a multiple of 10"
  - Else if ``dice`` is even (dice % 2 == 0), print "This is an even number" to the console
  - Else if ``dice`` is a multiple of 5 (dice % 5 == 0), print "You have rolled a multiple of 5"
  - Finally, have the default value print "I cannot understand your dice roll"
